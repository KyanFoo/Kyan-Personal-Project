README on how the my personal "Final_AuraOutline" Shader/

----------------- References from various "AuraOutline Shader" Links -----------------
1. AuraOutline#1: Unity The simplest outline - ShaderGraph (Stormer)
- This shader's outline scale is not what i imagine as the outline shape scale away from the GameObject itself.

2. AuraOutline#2: URP Outline Shader - Unity Shader Graph (Tutorial) (MichaelsGameLab)
- This shader has a "Fade Distance" node that makes the outline disappear when the camera is far away from it.
- This shader's outline is not really the one i'm looking for. When it scale, the outline shape breaks apart.

3. AuraOutline#3: URP Mesh Outlines Part 1 : Inky Effect Outline (Minions Art)
- This shader's outline scale has a bit of layers coming out, making it not smooth at all but the scale origin from the center.
